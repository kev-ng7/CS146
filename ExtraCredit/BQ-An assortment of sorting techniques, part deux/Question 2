Yes, given a max heap, we can use the max heap as a min heap without writing a whole min heap implementation. Same goes for a min
heap, we can use it as a max heap. To do this for a max heap, we will first negate all of the values before inserting into the priority queue
as a max heap. After that, we will negate all of those values again when deleting from the priority queue and then print it. The largest
negative value will correspond to the smallest positive value at the end, this will turn it into a min heap. The same process goes for
using a min heap as a max heap, negate all of the values before putting it into the priority queue as a min heap, and then negate the
values again when deleting from the min heap. The smallest negative value will correspond to the largest positive value.
