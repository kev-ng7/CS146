To solve this problem, we will use a two pointer approach, one at the beginning of the string and one at the end.
Initialize left pointer called left and right pointer called right, they will be put in a while loop that will end if they cross.
Two more while loops will be used in order to ignore all non-alphanumeric characters and increment/decrement the pointers until we get
to an alphanumeric character and compare. An if statement will be used to compare alphanumeric characters at both ends of the string
once we get to it and if it doesn't equal, then we will return false. Otherwise, it will return true and increment the left pointer
and decrement right pointer to compare the next two characters. This process will finish once left crosses right.
