To solve this problem of finding the first bad version, a binary search algorithm will be used to efficiently search for it.
A left pointer called left will be initialized with value 1 for for the first version, right pointer called right with value n for the last version.
The goal is to find the first bad version so while left < right, we will pass in the API into the if statement. If the bad version isn't
in the middle, the first bad version must be after mid, so then binary search will be done on the right side of mid. This is because for a bad version, all of the versions
after it will also be bad. If the bad version is in the middle, then binary search will be done on the left side of mid to find the first bad version. This process will keep 
going until left = right, then we have found our first bad version and return it.
