In problem 2, theres a triple for loop nested in with each other. The outer-most loop will have an order of growth n + 1.
The second nested loop will have an order of growth of (n)(n + 1). The inner-most loop will have an order of growth of (n)(n)(n + 1).
Adding up all of the costs, the time complexity for the matrix multiplication pseudocode will be cubic or O(n^3).
