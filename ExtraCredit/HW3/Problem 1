For the insertion sort algorithm, it has a for loop and a while loop nested inside of it. The for loop is increasing linearly, so 
it has an order of growth of n + 1. The nested while loop in the for loop in decreasing linearly as well, so it has an order of
growth of (n)(n - 1). Adding up all of the costs, the time complexity of the insertion sort algorithm will be O(n^2).
