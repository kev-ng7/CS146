We can use union find from disjoint sets to help solve this problem. This a minimum spanning tree problem so we don't want any cycles.
We can use union to find if there's any cycles, if union(x, y) have the same parent, then we know there's a cycle and return false.
Otherwise, we will return true and update the parent and rank for each node. After this, I'm not sure how to implement the rest of the
code to solve this problem.
